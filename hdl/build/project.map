ERROR:Pack:2412 - The number of logical LUT blocks exceeds the capacity for the target device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

      Number used as Single Port RAM:            0
      Number used as Shift Register:             0
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      2
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       136 out of   1,200   11%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        6,231
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,670 out of   6,231   26%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 205 out of   6,231    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       4,356 out of   6,231   69%
    Number of unique control sets:             291
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              51 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
